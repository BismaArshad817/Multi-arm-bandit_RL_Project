# Multi-arm-bandit_RL_Project
Overview
This project simulates n-armed bandit problems and advertisement bandits using Python, focusing on maximizing rewards through epsilon-greedy strategies.
**Requirements**
Python packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, dill
**Usage**
Adjust parameters (num_arms, num_tasks, num_steps, epsilons).
Run the code to simulate the bandit tasks.
Check generated plots for performance insights.
**Classes**
N_ARM_BANDIT: Represents an n-armed bandit with epsilon-greedy action selection.
AD_BANDIT: Models advertisement bandits, tracking rewards and actions.
**Data Visualization**
**Generates:**
Reward Trend Plot: Accumulated rewards over time for different epsilon values.
Final Reward Bar Plot: Total rewards achieved by each epsilon strategy.
